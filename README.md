To-Do

Hover over each job to find the member(s) assigned to it.

### Assigned to [Dradgit][drad]:

Look into the possibility of a method which traverses a list of chunks, and maybe uses pieces of a schematic which actually fit within the chunk being currently traversed in order to fully develop a chunk before moving on to other pieces of the schematic. This way, it would take full advantage of accessing a chunk object directly instead of using setBlock to change one block at a time.

Look into the possibility of adding a method to change one block type in a schema into another, giving blocks like torches, stairs, and slabs special treatment and conditions which place them exactly as they were placed previously. This would allow us to modify vanilla-made schemas into using custom textured and functionality blocks that we design, and still place them easily using the schematic and builder methods already created.

Add a large cone shaped dirt block formation below the floor of floor 1, to prevent people from falling into the abyss by accident. Possibly add more layers to the floor or get bfox to make the blocks indestructible already.

### Assigned to [Chris][chris]:

Weapons need a refined power system, chris is currently working on it.

### Assigned to [Bfox][bfox]:

Working on Player and Individual skills that can be obtained or selected.

### Assigned to [Texturers][richard]/[Modelers][golden]:

Finish texture ideas for blocks (types of blocks listed in ItemBlockMetaData)

Bosses and mobs need models and we need ideas for specific mobs and bosses.

### Assigned to [SirPwn][sirpwns]:

We also need a way to make a safe zone. The best idea we had earlier was making a block that players could pass through but mobs could not.

### Assigned to [Earbuds][earbuds]

Making a Crafting system.

### Unassigned:

People need to build schematics then hand me a .schematic file.

Design and build the ForgeStation. The details on this are fuzzy, ask bfox.

Teleport crystal needs a GUI, but we're basically waiting for the foundation of floor 1 to be set before moving onto functionality of other floors. We could test it out by making multiple tele points on floor 1.

For after we get the frame of the teleport crystal working, we need a block that acts as an anti-teleport crystal field. 

Also, designs for dungeons, designs for the flatland areas in-between towns. Need more details on how this should look. Are there roads? Do they follow a cardinal pattern when exiting the town? How about other towns on the outskirts of floor 1?

How will the dungeon traps work? What kinds of things other than the safe zones and dark room mob spawning will there be? 

What kinds of enemies are there in SAO? A lot of things I've been hearing about it mention fighting off waves of mobs. What kinds of mobs are those? Are they generic? Do they have special properties/elemental weaknesses/defences?

How will towns work? Will it just be villagers with a custom trading inventory? What kinds of things will you be able to trade for? Weapons you can buy? Trade for with what? Will we have to design a tile entity block to manage shop sales?

Custom holographic texture that appears on players when they're looking at a shop? Something client-side that shows up that only lets that player click on it? *Basically just a cosmetic feature that makes buying items from a shop seem really important or cool.

Auto-building house block? Will we just make it out of vanilla blocks for now or hard-code in some mod blocks to use in the future.
